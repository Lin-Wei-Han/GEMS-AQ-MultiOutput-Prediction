# Satellite-Grounded Fusion for Hourly Air Quality Prediction

This repository contains the source code for the study "Satellite-Grounded Fusion for Hourly Air Quality Prediction: Insights from GEMS-Based Modeling in Taiwan". It implements a multi-output CatBoost model within a rolling validation framework to predict hourly concentrations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, CO, and SO2).
